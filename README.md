# Polkadot Substrate Development Bootcamp

Welcome to my repository for the Polkadot Substrate Development Bootcamp! This repository contains my solutions to the hands-on projects of the bootcamp.

## Overview

The Polkadot Substrate Development Bootcamp is a comprehensive program that equips participants with the skills and knowledge to develop and customize their own blockchains using the Substrate framework. In this repository, I have shared my solutions to key projects completed during the bootcamp.

### Projects

I have successfully completed the following projects:

1. **Hands on Project - 01**: This project involved building a basic blockchain from scratch.
2. **Hands on Project - 02**: In this project, I simulated a blockchain network with two nodes and verified block production.
3. **Hands on Project - 03**: Adding trusted nodes to the network was the focus of this project.
4. **Hands on Project - 04**: I made changes to the `substrate-node-template` repository in this project. Focus of the project was to authorize specific nodes to produce blocks.
5. **Hands on Project - 08**: I built and interacted with a smart contract in this project.

### Project Details

Final case of the bootcamp was to complete hands on project 1, 2, 3 and 8.
I have completed all of them and you can find my solutions in the following folders:

- [Hands on Project - 01](./project_01)
- [Hands on Project - 02](./project_02)
- [Hands on Project - 03](./project_03)
- [Hands on Project - 08](./project_08)

You will find folders containing solutions to optional exercises from the bootcamp, each project equipped with its respective **README** file providing instructions for running the exercise.

Some of the projects have screenshot files to show the output of the project. Additionally, [Project 03](./project_03) has `customSpec` files to show the changes I made to the `chainSpec` file.

Lastly, I am leaving the link to my fork of the `substrate-node-template` repository [here](https://github.com/jaw3l/substrate-node-template/tree/learn_substrate). I have created a branch called `learn_substrate` and I have pushed all the changes I made to the `substrate-node-template` repository to that branch. You can find more information about the changes I made in the [Project 04](./project_04) folder.
